                <p class="lead carousel-text-position">The Amazon Echo was the first widespread smart voice assistant which wasn't in a mobile phone. Competitors didn't follow up until around two years later which gives the echo a large advantage over other devices in terms of optimization
                  and compatibility. The Echo is the most popular smart assistant device and for good reason. With multiple types of sister devices, the assistant can be found in many styles and sizes.<br/><br/> Many people who buy an Echo device buy
                  it because saying "Alexa" seems much more human than other assistants including "Hey Google" or "Hey Siri". <br/><br/> If you're looking for a device that has the widest range of compatibility combined with a human-like assistant and
                  many devices to choose from; Echo devices are for you.

                <p class="lead carousel-text-position">Google Home was created as competition for the Amazon Echo, released at the end of 2016. Echo may be the king of smart home compatibility but conversation and finding information online is where the Google Home shines. <br/><br/>
                  Google is new to the smart assistant game but they're quickly catching up to Amazon and may even be better for your needs. Although it's difficult to say how much Google are investing in their smart assistant game, it's definitely the biggest competitor for Amazon and could surpass the Echo with future releases. <br/><br/>
                  If Google can change the wake word of the Home and add better smart home compatibility, it could easily become the untouchable leader of smart home technology.

                <p class="lead carousel-text-position">The Apple HomePod is a lesser known device which is an attempt to combine the features of the Google Home and Amazon Echo. The price of the HomePod may throw a lot of people off this product as it comes with a much more premium price tag compared to it's competitors. <br/><br/>
                  The HomePod offers an amazing speaker system and simplicity which easily beats it's competitors. The downside of owning a HomePod is that it forces you to join up with the Apple Ecosystem. If you're already a part of this ecosystem then this device could be for you. </br><br/>
                  Apple releases it's own smart home products which connect seeminglessly with the HomePod and iPhone/iPad. Being part of this ecosystem is a blessing and a curse. It's great because of it's reliability, security, and simplicity, but it's a curse because you're locked into Apple's expensive, controlled ecosystem.
